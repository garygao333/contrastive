# Calculating Relative Polarity Scores for Multilingual Wikipedia Articles Using Contrastive Learning

In this notebook, we will compare two of the most commonly used machine-learning sentiment analysis models and our own model: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and a Contrastive Learning Model with Relative Polarity. These models will be trained and tested on 100 paired English and German Wikipedia articles on the topic of the second world war.
